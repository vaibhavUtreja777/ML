Plus viva-style Q&A at the end

1. Preprocessing & Normalization (Numerically)
Input:
python

import numpy as np

X = np.array([[1, 200], [2, 300], [3, 400], [4, 500]], dtype=float)
y = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40], dtype=float)
Normalization (Min-Max Scaling):

X_min = X.min(axis=0)
X_max = X.max(axis=0)
X_norm = (X - X_min) / (X_max - X_min)
2. Gradient Descent for Linear Regression (Without Sklearn)
We want to minimize the loss:

𝐽

𝜃
)
=
1
2
𝑚
∑
(
𝑦
−
𝑋
𝜃
)
2
J(θ)= 
2m

​
 ∑(y−Xθ) 
2
 
Code:
python
Copy
Edit
# Add bias term
X_b = np.c_[np.ones((X_norm.shape[0], 1)), X_norm]

# Initialize parameters
theta = np.random.randn(X_b.shape[1])
lr = 0.01
epochs = 1000

# Gradient descent loop
for epoch in range(epochs):
    gradients = -2 / len(X_b) * X_b.T.dot(y - X_b.dot(theta))
    theta = theta - lr * gradients

print("Learned Parameters:", theta)
3. Regularization (Lasso & Ridge)
Ridge (L2) Regularization

Lasso (L1) Regularization

Ridge Code:
python
Copy
Edit
lambda_ = 0.1
for epoch in range(epochs):
    gradients = -2 / len(X_b) * X_b.T.dot(y - X_b.dot(theta)) + 2 * lambda_ * theta
    theta = theta - lr * gradients
Lasso Code (Approximate):
python
Copy
Edit
for epoch in range(epochs):
    l1_grad = lambda_ * np.sign(theta)  # sign for L1
    gradients = -2 / len(X_b) * X_b.T.dot(y - X_b.dot(theta)) + l1_grad
    theta = theta - lr * gradients
4. Viva Questions & Answers
Question	Answer
What is normalization and why is it needed?	It rescales features to a common scale to improve model performance and convergence speed.
What does gradient descent do?	It minimizes the loss function by updating weights in the opposite direction of the gradient.
What is the difference between L1 and L2 regularization?	L1 adds absolute values (sparse model); L2 adds squared values (small weights).
When to use Lasso vs Ridge?	Lasso when you want feature selection; Ridge when all features matter and you want to prevent overfitting.
What is the role of lambda in regularization?	It controls the strength of penalty; higher lambda = more shrinkage.

Great! Here's how to do the same steps using sklearn — for preprocessing, linear regression, and both Ridge and Lasso regularization, plus how to visualize loss curves if needed.

✅ 1. Preprocessing and Normalization (with sklearn)
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

X = [[1, 200], [2, 300], [3, 400], [4, 500]]
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

print("Normalized X:\n", X_scaled)
✅ 2. Linear Regression with sklearn
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

y = [10, 20, 30, 40]
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_scaled, y)

print("Coefficients:", model.coef_)
print("Intercept:", model.intercept_)
✅ 3. Ridge & Lasso Regularization with sklearn
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge, Lasso

ridge = Ridge(alpha=0.1)
ridge.fit(X_scaled, y)
print("Ridge Coefficients:", ridge.coef_)

lasso = Lasso(alpha=0.1)
lasso.fit(X_scaled, y)
print("Lasso Coefficients:", lasso.coef_)
✅ 4. Plotting Loss Curve (using manual gradient descent)
If you implemented gradient descent manually, you can track loss per epoch like this:

python
Copy
Edit
losses = []
for epoch in range(epochs):
    preds = X_b.dot(theta)
    loss = np.mean((preds - y) ** 2)
    losses.append(loss)

    gradients = -2 / len(X_b) * X_b.T.dot(y - preds)
    theta = theta - lr * gradients

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(losses)
plt.title("Loss Curve over Epochs")
plt.xlabel("Epochs")
plt.ylabel("MSE Loss")
plt.show()
🎓 Summary Comparison
Task	Manual (NumPy)	With sklearn
Normalization	min-max formula	MinMaxScaler()
Linear Regression	Manual GD	LinearRegression()
Ridge	+ λ * θ² in loop	Ridge(alpha=λ)
Lasso	`+ λ *	θ
Loss Visualization	Custom plot	Not built-in, manual needed
